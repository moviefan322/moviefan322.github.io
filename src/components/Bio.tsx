            I am a full stack web developer from Boston MA. I started writing
            code about 16 years ago. I started with Java and then moved to web
            technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I have worked for
            companies as well as ran my own. In 2016 I started creating content
            full-time. I love helping people learn to code and better their
            lives.
